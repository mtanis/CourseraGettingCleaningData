## Cleaing the Data
The following steps were taken to clean the data:
1. Data was loaded from local folders
2. Mean and Standard Deviation variables were identified
3. Headers were cleaned to be more readable
4. Train and Test data were loaded
5. Train and Test data were merged
6. Column names were cleaned up
7. Data was melted and then cast to provide the mean of each variable for a given activity and subject combination
